# How to run the program
1. Open main.py.
2. Scroll down to the main function.
3. Update the file names for the function run(). The first argument is the filename for predefined words, and the second argument is the filename for input file.
4. Run the python script.

# What has been tested
1. Empty file for predefined words outputs nothing, except for the print headers. (empty_predefined.txt)
2. Empty file for input file outputs 0 for all predefined words. (empty_input.txt)
3. Example given in the problem statement. (test1_input.txt, test1_predefined)
4. Sentence with preceding or ending punctuations (test2_input.txt, test2_predefined)
5. Matching word that doesn't appear in the input file (test2_input.txt, test2_predefined)
6. One character word that does exist and doesn't exist in the input file (test2_input.txt, test2_predefined)
7. Case insensitivity (test2_input.txt, test2_predefined)
8. Matching word appears multiple times in the input file (test2_input.txt, test2_predefined).
